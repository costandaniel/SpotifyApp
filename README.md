Practicing Web development with a FullStack web application
This is my initial full stack web app developed using React.js and Node.js.
The app allows the user to login and check their profile information, for example details regarding the most played tracks for the logged in user.
During the development of this app I have learned Node.js along with how to manage server requests, dynamically loading components based on a request, APIs, and authentication.
